Tools for EBSP band characterisation and imaging
This repository presents analysis workflows for spherical-angular dark field imaging of EBSPs. This functions by refining pattern centres, reprojecting onto the diffraction sphere, and integrating calculated cross-sectional profiles within a Bragg angle.

It requires AstroEBSD, mtex (version 5.2-beta2 was used in development), and Chebfun:
